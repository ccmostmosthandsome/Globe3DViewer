# Globe 3D viewer
This is one-click 3D viewer plugin to view designs generated in Geodesign Hub with a [CesiumJS](https://cesiumjs.org/) Globe. It takes diagrammatic designs from [Geodesign Hub API](https://www.geodesignhub.com/api) and generates buildings, roads and renders them. In addition you can download the building footprints generated as GeoJSON.
